# Splendor Recreation

Welcome to my recreation of the board game Splendor in Python!

## Overview

This is a chance to demonstrate my python skills, practice making games, and potentially add some analysis of the game and computer players at a later date.

The project is fully functional, allowing players to progress from the start of the game to the end as intended with the exception of a few edge cases such as the inability to buy using jokers.

Players can save their game state to a JSON file at the end of each round and resume from where they left off in the next session.

While the game is currently text-based, future enhancements could include a rules explanation at the start of the game, colored fonts for improved readability, and visual enhancements for noble cards.

## Development Notes

### Future Development Ideas:

- Add code testing
- Incorporate a rules explanation at the start of the game.
- Implement additional error-proofing measures.
- Improve readability with colored fonts.
- Display the total number of remaining cards in each level deck.
- Enable the use of Jokers for purchases.
- Implement stricter token handling.
- Enhance code compliance with PEP8 standards.
- Improve the visual appeal of noble cards.
- Reduce code redundancy.
- Develop a bot capable of playing the game based on different strategies

### Lessons Learned:

- How to save and loading data from a JSON file.
- Managing multiple modules while maintaining data access.
- Working with standard Python data types and common loops.
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub.
- Handling user interface and input.
- Adhering to PEP8 coding conventions.
- Implementing error handling for incorrect user input.
- Effective use of dictionaries.
- Leveraging ChatGPT for code development assistance.
- Understanding the importance of iterative development and code refactoring.
- Utilizing existing Python modules such as os, copy, random, and json effectively.
- Overcoming challenges, such as dealing with cls errors and multiline quotes within lists.
- Exploring creative solutions for text-based game mechanics and interface limitations.
- Learning to prioritize between immediate fixes and future enhancements.
- Embracing the need to refactor or remove code when necessary for better solutions.
