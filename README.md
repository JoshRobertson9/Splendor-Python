Hello, here is my recreation of the board game Splendor.

This is a chance to demonstrate my python skills, practice making games, and potentially add some analysis of the game and computer players.

This project is just getting started and is not completed yet at this time.


What I'm learning

    Managing many modules while maintaining the necessary access to data

    Also managing modules while not pulling all functions

    Standard Pythton data types and common loops

    Practice with Git and Github

    Some user interface and input

    Practice aligning with PEP8

    Make it less easy to break. Responds to incorrect user entry

    Using dictionary for tokens

    Using Chat GPT to assist in some code development. Simulates working with another team member to develop code.

    The way you implement a solution can and does matter, but sometimes its best to just get started and change it from there. Hard to solve it all in your head.



Lessons Learned

    Don't use multiple line quotes (triple quotes) within a list. This will cause an issue...


To Add

    Clear the terminal as you go so that there isnt a long back-log.
