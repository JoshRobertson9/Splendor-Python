Hello, here is my recreation of the board game Splendor.

This is a chance to demonstrate my python skills, practice making games, and potentially add some analysis of the game and computer players.

This project is just getting started and is not completed yet at this time.


What I'm learning

    Managing many modules while maintaining the necessary access to data

    Standard Pythton data types and common loops

    Practice with Git and Github

    Some user interface and input

    Practice aligning with PEP8

    Make it less easy to break. Responds to incorrect user entry

Lessons Learned

    Don't use multiple line quotes (triple quotes) within a list. This will cause an issue...
