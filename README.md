Hello, here is my recreation of the board game Splendor.

This is a chance to demonstrate my python skills, practice making games, and potentially add some analysis of the game and computer players.

This project is just getting started and is not completed yet at this time.

It is text based, which isn't as easy to play, but the bones of it are setup and something like that could be added to it later.

What I'm learning

    Managing many modules while maintaining the necessary access to data

    Also managing modules while not pulling all functions

    Standard Pythton data types and common loops

    Practice with Git and Github

    Some user interface and input

    Practice aligning with PEP8

    Make it less easy to break. Responds to incorrect user entry

    Using dictionary for tokens

    Using Chat GPT to assist in some code development. Simulates working with another team member to develop code.

    The way you implement a solution can and does matter, but sometimes its best to just get started and change it from there. Hard to solve it all in your head.

    used several existing modules. os, copy, & random.

    cls has an error and won't delete the scrollback buffer.

Lessons Learned

    Don't use multiple line quotes (triple quotes) within a list. This will cause an issue...

    Making this game text based in not the ideal way to play this game, but it was fund to try to see how to make the best of that situation and see what creative fixes could be applied there. (Added line breaks, cleared the terminal, moved outputs from multiple lines into a single line.)

    Sometimes writing the comment of things to add in the future takes more time than to just fix it now

    Sometimes you have to delete code you worked hard on if its no longer the best solution.

To Add

    Clear the terminal as you go so that there isnt a long back-log.

    Scenarios when picking coins based on remaining amount
    
    Could try to "solve" the game based on which cards held could lead to free purchase of other cards and how that stacks and then rank which to pick first because they lead to so many others. Could make a bot that does this. Each card is essentially scored based on this to determine which to pick next.

    Reference open source projects to learn how they do/solve various tasks

    Could add the total number of remaining cards in a level deck
